        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> Beef and Broccoli is a beloved Chinese-American dish that combines tender slices of beef with crisp broccoli florets in a savory sauce. This quick and easy stir fry is perfect for busy weeknights, offering a balance of protein and vegetables in a flavorful meal. </p>

        <p> The beef is typically marinated to ensure it stays juicy and absorbs the flavors of the sauce, while the broccoli is cooked until just tender-crisp, maintaining its vibrant green color and nutritional value. </p>
